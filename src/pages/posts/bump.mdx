We documented our little boy growing inside us week by week. Being a first time mama I didn't really begin to show until 15 weeks pregnant so that's when we began snapping a photo each week. These are the non edited raw pregnancy snaps and we never got a chance to get one when I hit 40 weeks. Mason was born 40+2!\
