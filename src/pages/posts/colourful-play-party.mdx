We are one to host parties and decided a party filled with the people closest to Mason sounded perfect.

Our house is small so choosing a venue was needed and after looking into a couple of community rooms for hire we found one just 6 minutes drive from us. It was prepped with a kitchen, tables, chairs, couches, children's play toys, a deck and even outside play area. It was perfect for the type of party we were hosting.

If you follow us on Instagram you will know we love to play and are all about play-based learning in our house.\
We wanted the party to be focussed 100% on Mason and what he enjoys. Ensuring he had fun on his day so we surrounded him only with people he had met more then twice, chose a colourful bright theme and provided areas of play.

**PLAY SPACE**\

On the deck we set up a space for messy play. Simply a tarpaulin with a shell pool filled with oats and scoops. Rainbow coloured pasta in a tray and a mini pool with balls floating in bubbly water.\

**DECOR**

Being a colourful theme I wanted to run with that. I felt it was easy enough to stick to and a pretty straight forward way to decorate without spending crazy amounts or having to source items from all over the show.\
![](http://sigourneylouise.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC9348.jpg)I created a backdrop wall using a white sheet and streamers. The streamers are hung from a piece of brown string.\
Of course I'm a sucker for photos and have thousands so I created the number ONE photo board myself with a bit of help from my lovely sister n law Taylor. The info board about Mase was purchased from KMART and I love knowing we could share these special things about him to everyone. The grazing table idea was just the easiest. We had limited time to set up so I thought this was was going to be best affective and fastest. The cake was made by my talented sister Verity.![](http://sigourneylouise.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC9347.jpg)![](http://sigourneylouise.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC9351.jpg)

![](http://sigourneylouise.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC9345.jpg)Mason was going to do his own cake smash so created a space where his highchair could go for him to eat it.\
Along with the rainbow theme I wanted to keep the rest neutral. I'm into simplistic, meaningful spaces so this part I kept just that. The highchair is ours from home by Kiwiliving and the balloon is from Look Sharp. My sister Verity also made his mini cake.

I chose to merge the drinks, guest book and gifts all together. I simply placed some cups with a ice bucket of two soft drinks and a drink dispenser with some fruit water. We purchased a brown paper hardcover book for people to write a message in to Mase and provided an ink pad so the babies could leave their mark too. On the wall I displayed his monthly milestone photos taken from newborn through to turning one.

The last set up space I created was a food table for the kids. A low children's sized table where they could all sit together and eat. It was so cute seeing them all happily eating together. Mason was so focused on his food he didn't try to get off the chair once! I bought the table cloth from KMART as well as the bottles and wooden rainbow.
